#Felt API Stream
A Version of FeltAPI meant for our needs of porting mods which will be pushed upstream.

# Felt API
A Minecraft modding API to supplement Fabric API.

## What is Felt API?
Felt API is a combination of ports from MinecraftForge, ports from QuiltMC, and our own efforts.
In short we wish to make Minecraft modding on Fabric as simple as possible.

## Port to Forge?
No, but you're welcome to do it yourself if you'd like

## Quilt?
Quilt is for sleeping :D
